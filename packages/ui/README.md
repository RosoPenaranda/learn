## ðŸ—º Getting around / project structure
Project CM is divided into 3 (currently) main packages.
- [**`api`**](packages/api/README.md): The NestJS API package that powers all our data ([api.codementoring.co](https://api.codementoring.co))
- [**`client`**](packages/client/README.md): The React package that provides the UI/front-end for the project ([learn.codementoring.co](https://learn.codementoring.co))
- [**`ui`**](packages/ui/README.md): A React project for all the UI components to live. (Will eventually be reused in the **[WWW/marketing site](https://github.com/code-mentoring/www)**)
